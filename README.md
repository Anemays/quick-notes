## üìå Current Status

This project is still in early development. Known limitations:

1. Editing a note cannot replace or remove the uploaded file.
2. Deleting a note does not delete the associated file from MinIO (orphaned file).
3. Uploaded files are stored, but their URLs are not yet displayed in the frontend.
4. Bucket is private, so files are not accessible without a signed URL.
5. Tailwind layout still needs improvements (e.g., color contrast and spacing).
6. No input validation yet ‚Äî the "Add" button accepts empty titles (though nothing is submitted).
7. Uploaded file input is not reset after submission.
